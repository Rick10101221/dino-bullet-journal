### Description of Project

Our project will be a digital bullet journal. The bullet journal give users the ability to keep track of both long-term and short-term goals. They are able to see the goals that they have set for the month and the year. We also give users the ability to save photos every day so that they can come back to that day later on and look at them. It now has a nice weekly overview on the landing page to see the week at a glance and additionally a calendar page to see how tasks are spread out and navigate to certain day of the months and years. There is a secure login now which allows multiple users on a device as well as users being able to use multiple devices.
